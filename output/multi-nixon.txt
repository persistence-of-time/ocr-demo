National Security Study Memorandum 64

TO: The Secretary of Defense

SUBJECT: U.S. Strategic Capabilities

As a result of National Security Council discussion of the U.S,
strategic posture, prepared in response to National Security Study
Memorandums 3 and 24, the President has directed that you prepare
a follow-on study as follows:

With respect to strategic nuclear attacks on the United States,
evaluate U.S. strategic forces projected through 1978 in terms
of (a) their capability to deter and respond to less than all-out
or disarming Soviet attacks, and (b) a range of possible war
outcome measures in addition to surviving population and industry,
such as surviving military and other economic assets, The analysis
should be based on both low and high Soviet force levels in the
National Intelligence Projections for Planning and on greater than
expected threats.

The analysis should include consideration of the actual and
required capabilities of the U.S, command and control system
under the postulated operational situations,

The study should also address the following questions:

-- What general strategic force levels and what types of
force mixes and force characteristics are indicated to improve

relative U.S, strategic capabilities as now projected?

-- What improvements, if any, seem indicated for our
programmed strategic command and control systems ?

-- Based on the analysis, what modifications or changes to
the criteria for strategic sufficiency should be considered?

of the study with the Office of the Assistant to the President for

National Security Affairs.

The Director, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

SUBJECT: Uranium Enrichment Facilities

In connection with the Government's wider study of the
feasibility of alternative ownership arrangements for U.S.
enriched uranium production facilities, the President has
directed that the Political Military Group undertake a study
to investigate the national security implications of possible
forms of public and private ownership in the following terms:

-- their effect on the continued availability of highly
enriched uranium for U.S. national security purposes, and
the maintenance of adequate weapons materials inventories,

-- their effect on the availability of enriched uranium to
consuming countries who buy from the U.S., and

-- their effect on the dissemination of weapons materials
producing technology and special nuclear materials to potential
users, and thereby on the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation.

If appropriate, the Political Military Group should suggest

guidelines or criteria which minimize the national security risks
of each form of ownership.

Meeting with the leaders of the APS, APF, and other pain societies.

This is the meeting that Campbell and Foley wanted to happen at the APS, but we declined.

i want it to be in Stamford if possible, or NYC as a fallback. Our goal is to bind these
organizations more closely to us than heretofore, but also to align them with our expanded
mission and to see that the fate of our product(s) are inextricably bound up with the trajectory
of the pain movement.
