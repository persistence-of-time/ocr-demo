In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law and subject to conditions hereinafter described, interest on the Bonds (a) will not be included in gross
income for federal income tax purposes except for interest on any of the Bonds for any period during which such Bonds are held by a person who is a “substantial
user” of the facilities financed by the Bonds or a “related person” within the meaning of Section 103(b)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and
(b) will not be an item of tax preference for purposes of the alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations; provided, however, with respect to
corporations (as defined for federal income tax purposes), such interest is taken into account in determining adjusted current earnings for the purpose of computing the
federal alternative minimum tax on corporations. In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing statutes, interest on the Bonds is exempt from all present state income
taxation within the State of Georgia. See “TAX EXEMPTION” herein.
