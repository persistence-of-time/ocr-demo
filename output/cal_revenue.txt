              MONTHLY CASH REPORT

Preliminary General Fund agency cash receipts for the first five months of the fiscal year are $56 million below the
forecast of $47.736 billion. Cash receipts for November were $148 million below the 2019-20 Budget Act forecast of
$8.890 billion, which reflects hundreds of millions of dollars in personal income tax withholding shifting from November
to December.

M@ Personal income tax cash receipts to the General Fund for the first five months of the fiscal year were $826 million
below forecast. November cash receipts were $219 million below the month’s forecast of $5.356 billion. Withholding
receipts were $714 million below the estimate of $5.734 billion. Due likely to bonus payments, the Monday following
Thanksgiving is historically a day of abnormally large withholding. Normally falling in November, it fell this year in
December. The cash forecast reflected this day's receipts in November, which overstated the month's revenues. It is
expected that a large portion of this variance will be reflected in December's receipts. Other receipts were $1 million
above the forecast of $783 million. Refunds issued in November were $490 million below the expected
$1.065 billion. Proposition 63 requires that 1.76 percent of total monthly personal income tax collections be transferred

the forecast of $96 million.
