The Director, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

SUBJECT: Uranium Enrichment Facilities

In connection with the Government's wider study of the
feasibility of alternative ownership arrangements for U.S.
enriched uranium production facilities, the President has
directed that the Political Military Group undertake a study
to investigate the national security implications of possible
forms of public and private ownership in the following terms:

-- their effect on the continued availability of highly
enriched uranium for U.S. national security purposes, and
the maintenance of adequate weapons materials inventories,

-- their effect on the availability of enriched uranium to
consuming countries who buy from the U.S., and

-- their effect on the dissemination of weapons materials
producing technology and special nuclear materials to potential
users, and thereby on the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation.

If appropriate, the Political Military Group should suggest

guidelines or criteria which minimize the national security risks
of each form of ownership.
